# Intervals

Numbers in simple ratios should sound harmonious together.

Unfortunately, normal 12TET tuning can be far off:
| semitones | exact ratio | closest fraction | error | alternative |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| 1         | 1.059       | 18/17 = 1.058    | .001  |             |
| 2         | 1.122       | 9/8   = 1.125    | .003  |             |
| 3         | 1.189       | 6/5   = 1.200    | .011  |             |
| 4         | 1.259       | 5/4   = 1.250    | .009  |             |
| 5         | 1.334       | 4/3   = 1.333    | .001  |             |
| 6         | 1.414       | 17/12 = 1.416    | .002  | 7/5 = 1.400 |
| 7         | 1.498       | 3/2   = 1.500    | .002  |             |
| 8         | 1.587       | 19/12 = 1.583    | .004  | 8/5 = 1.600 |
| 9         | 1.681       | 5/3   = 1.666    | .015  |             |
| 10        | 1.781       | 16/9  = 1.777    | .004  | 7/4 = 1.750 |
| 11        | 1.887       | 17/9  = 1.888    | .001  |             |
| 12        | 2.000       | 2/1   = 2.000    | .000  |             |

With Pythagoras, you can play those ratios exactly. Especially interesting can be 6, 8 and 10 semitone intervals, as they don't have any simple fractions near them. Try to replace them with those more harmonious alternatives!

Some other simple fractions you can try, that you couldn't reach in standard 12TET tuning:
- 7/6 = 1.166
- 9/5 = 1.800
- 11/6 = 1.833
- 7/3 = 2.333
- 11/4 = 2.750
